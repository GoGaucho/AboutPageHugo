Hey Gauchos,

Are you interested in mobile app development, backend infrastructure, project management, web, graphic design, or marketing? Do you want the product you help create to be used by thousands of people, daily? Now is your chance to shine! 

If you haven’t heard of us already, we’re GoGaucho, a mobile application student organization who built the conveniently titled GoGaucho UCSB campus app. It contains all the information you or any student would need to know like dining menus, course schedules, registration info, with more features currently being developed!

Within the past quarter we broke over 16,000 downloads and over 8,600 MAU(Monthly Active Users), so we are excited to ramp up and recruit new members into our organization’s team! If you are looking to gain experience in writing production level code, work in an agile development workflow, manage a project end to end, or just simply want to create a brand new feature for the app, submit your application today!
